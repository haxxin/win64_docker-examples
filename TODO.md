# win64_docker-examples

## TODO

- [ ] setup PyTorch
- [x] `.env` was accidentally commited to the master branch -_-
  * we need to run BFG or such to remove all trace of this file for the sake
  of the tutorial
- [ ] verify the timestamp of the conversation Michael and I had
    * <https://github.com/haxxin/win64_docker-examples/wiki/R&D#>
